Actions:
- Swap server: rotates the direction of the arrow above 180*
- Next game: Persists player names and game wins, clears score inputs
- Save match: save names, wins & scores; Push match details into the GameHistory section (ordered by most recently saved); Then clear player names, match wins and scores
- Reset: Clear names, wins and scores -> perhaps with a confirmation modal but that's a "nice to have"
